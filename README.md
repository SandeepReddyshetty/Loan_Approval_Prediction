# Loan_Approval_Prediction

## Problem Statement
The company seeks to automate (in real-time) the loan qualifying procedure based on information given by customers while filling out an online application form. It is expected that the development of ML models that can help the company predict loan approval in accelerate the decision-making process for determining whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.

### Objectives of Notebook ðŸ“ŒÂ¶
ðŸ‘‰ This notebook aims to:

- Build various ML models that can predict loan approval
The machine learning models used in this project are:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

### Data Set Description ðŸ§¾Â¶
ðŸ‘‰ There are 13 variables in this data set:

- 8 categorical variables,
- 4 continuous variables, and
- 1 variable to accommodate the loan ID.
